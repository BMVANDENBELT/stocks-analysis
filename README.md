# stocks-analysis

# Purpose

 -  The purpose of this project was to refactor an Excel/VBA code to display stock information from the years 2017 and 2018. The original format was sound but with our modifications it aimed to be more effective. 
 

# Results

 -  The set up for the code was pretty much given to us already (i.e. it ran successfully) but I had to copy it and enter it into VBA where I created inputs and tickers to give us the desired output after running the script. The provided instructions set me up for success, all I had to do was refactor it with the correct paths and my stocks would be displayed poperly. From the return alone, it should be noted that 2017 yielded a far higher amount as there is not much red on the table. The same cannot be said for 2018, red covers a large part of it as the stock is trending downward for most (except two of them). I have attached the refactored code as well as the stock information for 2017 & 2018 for better description of my analysis.

# Summary

 -  Because we refactored, one thing that should stand out the most is the time it took to run the macro as a whole. For 2017, the original macro was ran at a speed of approximately 0.27 seconds while the same macro (but refactored) ran at 0.07 seconds. Much faster. For 2018, 0.27 seconds and for the refactored 2018 macro, 0.08 seconds. 
 -  At the end of the day, refactoring just makes the code you ingest more organized. For me personally, if I am having a hard time *seeing* what is in the window I'm probably going to have an even harder time understanding which component applies to what. When it's refactored it becomes easier to read, even for those who aren't computer-science inclined. One disadvantage that sticks out to me most is the fact that some applications are far too larg to refactor. The reason being: it becomes risky to the integrity of the 
original code when we start making changes to "optimize" it for efficiency.
